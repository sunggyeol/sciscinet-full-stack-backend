# SciSciNet VT-CS Preprocessed Dataset

This dataset is a highly specific, pre-processed subset of the original **SciSciNet-v1** dataset, created to support the 2026 Coding Test projects.

The final data is stored in a single SQLite database: `sciscinet_vt_cs.db`.

## Filtering Criteria

This dataset was generated by filtering the complete SciSciNet-v1 TSV files based on three main criteria:

1.  **Affiliation:** All papers are associated with the 'Virginia Tech' main campus (AffiliationID: 859038795).
2.  **Field of Study:** All papers are categorized under at least one of 39 pre-defined Computer Science-related fields (e.g., 'Computer science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Data mining').
3.  **Date Range:** All papers were published between **2015-2022**. (Note: The filter was set for 2015-2025, but the v1 dataset's coverage ends in 2022).

## Key Statistics

* **Final Paper Count (VT-CS, 2015-2022):** 8,627
* **Total Papers (VT, 2015-2022):** 32,674
* **Total Citation Links:** 354,180
* **Unique Authors (on VT-CS papers):** 42,152
* **CS Fields:** 39

## Database Schema

The `sciscinet_vt_cs.db` database contains the following tables:

* `papers`: The main table for the 32,674 VT papers from 2015-2022. Includes `paper_id`, `title`, `year`, `citation_count`, and `patent_count`.
* `paper_details`: Stores paper abstracts (`abstract`) linked by `paper_id`. Note: Abstracts were not present in the SciSciNet-v1 `PaperDetails.tsv` file, so this table is largely empty.
* `paper_author_affiliations`: Links papers to authors (`paper_id`, `author_id`) for all VT-affiliated authors.
* `paper_fields`: Links the 8,627 CS papers to their respective CS fields (`paper_id`, `field_id`).
* `paper_references`: Stores the citation network links (`paper_id`, `reference_id`) for the final CS papers.
* `affiliations`: Stores the 'Virginia Tech' affiliation name and ID.
* `fields`: Stores the 39 CS field names and IDs.
