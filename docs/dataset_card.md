# SciSciNet VT-CS Preprocessed Dataset

This dataset is a highly specific, pre-processed subset of the original **SciSciNet-v1** dataset, created to support the 2026 Coding Test projects.

The final data is stored in a single SQLite database: `sciscinet_vt_cs_2013_2022.db`.

## Filtering Criteria

This dataset was generated by filtering the complete SciSciNet-v1 TSV files based on three main criteria:

1.  **Affiliation:** All papers are associated with the 'Virginia Tech' main campus (AffiliationID: 859038795).
2.  **Field of Study:** All papers are categorized under at least one of 39 pre-defined Computer Science-related fields (e.g., 'Computer science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Data mining').
3.  **Date Range:** All papers were published between **2013-2022** (10 years from dataset cutoff). This range supports both Project 1 (T1: 2018-2022 for 5-year networks; T2: 2013-2022 for 10-year timeline) and Project 2 (LLM Agent analysis).

## Database Schema

The `sciscinet_vt_cs_2013_2022.db` database contains the following tables:

* `papers`: The main table for the 39,903 VT papers from 2013-2022. Includes `paper_id`, `title`, `year`, `citation_count`, and `patent_count`.
* `paper_details`: Stores paper abstracts (`abstract`) linked by `paper_id`. Contains 10,293 abstracts for CS papers.
* `paper_author_affiliations`: Links papers to authors (`paper_id`, `author_id`, `affiliation_id`) for all VT-affiliated authors. Contains 193,408 records across 42,152 unique authors.
* `paper_fields`: Links the 10,293 CS papers to their respective CS fields (`paper_id`, `field_id`). Contains 18,047 field assignments.
* `paper_references`: Stores the citation network links (`paper_id`, `reference_id`) for the final CS papers. Contains 424,616 citation links.
* `affiliations`: Stores the 'Virginia Tech' affiliation name and ID.
* `fields`: Stores the 39 CS field names and IDs.

## Index Performance

The following indexes are created for fast query performance:
- `idx_papers_year` - For filtering papers by publication year
- `idx_papers_id` - For fast paper lookups
- `idx_paa_paper`, `idx_paa_author`, `idx_paa_affil` - For author-affiliation queries
- `idx_pf_paper`, `idx_pf_field` - For field-based queries
- `idx_pr_paper`, `idx_pr_ref` - For citation network traversal
- `idx_pd_paper` - For paper details lookups

## Project Applications

**Project 1 - Full-Stack Web Development:**
- **T1 (Citation & Collaboration Networks):** Uses papers from 2018-2022 (19,796 papers, 5-year window)
- **T2 (Timeline + Patent Distribution):** Uses papers from 2013-2022 (39,903 papers, 10-year window)
- **T3 (Network Refinement):** Builds on T1 data with advanced visualizations

**Project 2 - LLM Agent Analysis:**
- Uses all VT CS papers from 2013-2022 (10,293 papers)
- All tables are pre-filtered for VT + CS + year range
